// The last resort for a failure that has nowhere else to go: a detached task or
// a callback threw, no application sink was configured to receive it, and no
// caller will ever rethrow it. Writing one line to stderr is the only remaining
// way to keep it observable.
//
// Discarding it instead would make the fault undiagnosable, and terminating
// would turn one local failure into a whole-process one. Every layer routes its
// unowned failures here so a Ruvia process never fails silently, and so the
// diagnostic looks the same wherever it came from:
//
//     ruvia: <context> failed: <what>
//
// `context` names the failing unit ("web connection", "event loop stop callback").
// Writing is best effort -- stderr may be closed, full, or redirected -- but
// nothing beyond this point could report the failure either way.
//
// Rate limited: a fault that fails every connection at once would otherwise
// bury the first, informative failure under its consequences, and a blocked
// stderr would slow the recovery it is describing. Excess reports are counted
// and the count travels with the next line that gets through, so the volume is
// bounded without the flood becoming invisible. An application that wants every
// failure should install its layer's sink instead of relying on this.
